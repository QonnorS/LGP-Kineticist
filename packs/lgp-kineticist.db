In addition, by spending Focus Points while preparing nonmagical food items with the Crafting skill, you can include a potion as part of the ingredients. This gives that food item the potion and occult traits. Any food created this way has the same monetary value as food that would have been prepared normally. You can create a full meal as part of preparing for a day&rsquo;s adventure, expending one potion and 1 Focus Point per four servings. Unlike the potions you Craft with@Compendium[lgp-cabalist.lgp-cabalist.hzSb5TFtoK3rCRHD]{Toil and Trouble}, these do not lose potency until the food would spoil normally. The effects of multiple meals do not stack. The GM makes your Crafting check in secret against a flat DC equal to twice the item level of the potion used to determine the results:</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The food is of exceptional quality and enhances the magical effects of the potion. The potion&rsquo;s effects occur as soon as the serving of food is consumed completely, and if it has a duration of less than 24 hours normally, extend that duration to 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Success </strong>The effects of the potion used for the food are delayed, occurring 4 hours after the serving is consumed completely. If it has a duration of less than 1 hour normally, extend that duration to 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> Your potion is wasted. Your cooking skills are bad, and you should feel bad. Those who consumed your meal do not benefit from your potion and are instead @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened} 1 and cannot reduce their @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened} value below 1 for 1 hour.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> Not only do you waste your potion, but your meal is hazardous. Those who consumed it receive no benefits from your potion and are instead @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened} 2 and cannot reduce their @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened} condition below 2 for 1 hour or below 1 for 24 hours.
