These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Occult Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>As a result of your animus&rsquo;s blessings, you can harness occult power to cast spells. You can cast occult spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, verbal, and somatic components when casting spells. <br /><br />At 1st level you can prepare up to two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells known by your familiar. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots. Due to the considerable influence your animus carries over the aspects of your life and over your powers, one of these spell slots of each level must be used to prepare an animus spell of that level or lower.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a cabalist, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spell you can cast from spell slots increases, as shown on the table below.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability score is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell&rsquo;s level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn&rsquo;t use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up - this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a cabalist. For example, as a 1st-level cabalist, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level cabalist, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color: white; width: 120px; background-color: #522e2c; text-align: center; height: 25px;\" colspan=\"12\">* The magnum opus class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: var(--p-space); max-width: min(90%,var(--max-width)); width: 520px; font-family: 'Roboto Condensed',var(--sans-serif);\"><strong>Familiar</strong></h3>\n<p>As part of granting you their power, your animus gifts you with a familiar to act as a living channel for your magic. In addition to the normal benefits of possessing a familiar, your familiar also functions much the way a wizard&rsquo;s spellbook might, except spells are instinctively known by it, and it shares those spells with you via an empathic bond when you commune with it as part of preparing your spells for the day. It knows your choice of ten occult cantrips and five 1st-level occult spells. You choose these from the occult spell list or other occult spells to which you have access.</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level, your familiar gains two occult spells of any level of occult spell you can cast. You can also have it learn any other occult spells you find on your adventures, either by having it physically consume an item which contains the spell in question (such as a scroll) in a process which takes one hour, or by using the Learn a Spell activity to communicate with another familiar that knows the spell (paying any other costs normally required to do so, and potentially requiring some form of tribute paid to another cabalist&rsquo;s animus or a @Compendium[pf2e.classes.bYDXk9HUMKOuym9h]{Witch} patron).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If your familiar dies, your animus will replace it for you; this could occur anywhere from the next time you would prepare spells up to a week after the previous familiar&rsquo;s death, depending upon the circumstances and your animus&rsquo;s whim. The replacement may be a duplicate or a reincarnation of the previous familiar, or even an entirely new entity that could be a different species. You can also potentially receive a new familiar as your animus wishes, with it replacing or transforming the old one, though this is something your animus will determine the necessity of if you request it. Regardless of how you attain this new familiar, it will possess the same spells as your previous one. Losing your familiar will not affect any spells you already have prepared for the day, but you will not be able to prepare new spells until you have been granted a new familiar to replace the one you&rsquo;ve lost.</p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: var(--p-space); max-width: min(90%,var(--max-width)); width: 520px; font-family: 'Roboto Condensed',var(--sans-serif);\">Animus</h3>\n<p>You were granted your powers by a mysterious benefactor, a scion of some force with which you are aligned. You choose an @Compendium[lgp-cabalist.lgp-cabalist.oiHbdLEd1rRn0Rpe]{Animus}; this grants you a collection of additional spells which your familiar will learn (called animus spells), as well as an innate ability that your familiar gains. However, just as your animus grants you new abilities, it also proscribes you from the use of spells and abilities from opposing forces, making spells of certain traits or some actions anathema for you. Unlike the anathema of a champion or cleric&rsquo;s deities, where you may still perform such actions at the risk of losing class abilities, the proscription of an animus is typically a hard restriction.</p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: var(--p-space); max-width: min(90%,var(--max-width)); width: 520px; font-family: 'Roboto Condensed',var(--sans-serif);\"><strong>Animus Familiar</strong></h3>\n<p>Your familiar is more powerful than a typical familiar, as a wizard or sorcerer might attain; when preparing your familiar&rsquo;s abilities at the start of each day, it grants an additional master ability, and you can choose an additional familiar or master ability at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels. In addition, your familiar gains an innate ability, as determined by your chosen animus, which does not count toward the limit of familiar and master abilities it can have.</p>\n<h1 style=\"margin-top: var(--space-l); margin-bottom: var(--space-s); max-width: min(90%,var(--max-width)); width: 520px; font-family: var(--serif);\">Cabal</h1>\n<p>Freshly-initiated cabalists often need guidance from those with more experience to help them navigate their newlydiscovered abilities. You choose a @Compendium[lgp-cabalist.lgp-cabalist.gydUbJ1pH1hkLay7]{Cabal}; this grants you access to a class feat which represents the abilities of your chosen cabal as well as other added benefits that could shape how your powers as a cabalist develop.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: var(--p-space); max-width: min(90%,var(--max-width)); width: 520px; font-family: 'Roboto Condensed',var(--sans-serif);\"><strong>The Beastcallers</strong></h3>\n<p>Members of this cabal rely heavily upon their familiars not only as channels of their power, but as personal protectors.

At 1st level you gain the Brewmaster cabalist feat. In addition, you can select items with the oil or potion traits when gaining alchemical formulas even if they don&rsquo;t have the alchemical trait, and for each level you gain, your familiar learns two alchemical formulas for items of that level or lower.</p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: var(--p-space); max-width: min(90%,var(--max-width)); width: 520px; font-family: 'Roboto Condensed',var(--sans-serif);\"><strong>The Leyline Cult</strong></h3>\n<p>Those who become members of this cabal possess much greater skill in bringing out the magic granted by their anima than other cabalists. At 1st level you gain the Animus Magic cabalist feat, ignoring its prerequisites. When you Cast a Spell, if it&rsquo;s an animus spell, increase that spell&rsquo;s DCs by 1 plus one-fifth your level; this effect stacks with any circumstance or status bonuses your animus grants.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: var(--p-space); max-width: min(90%,var(--max-width)); width: 520px; font-family: 'Roboto Condensed',var(--sans-serif);\"><strong>The Seekers of the Perfect Form</strong></h3>\n<p>Members of this cabal possess the unique ability to control their hair as if it were another limb. At 1st level you gain the Bizarre Weaponry cabalist feat. Either your gnarled teeth or shreding nails attacks deal an additional 1d4 persistent bleed damage on a critical hit plus an additional 1d4 per five levels (maximum 5d4), or the reach of either your white hair or writhing tongue increases by 5 feet per five levels, (maximum 30 feet). These benefits only apply to the attack chosen when gaining this feat at 1st level.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: var(--p-space); max-width: min(90%,var(--max-width)); width: 520px; font-family: 'Roboto Condensed',var(--sans-serif);\"><strong>The Vengeful</strong></h3>\n<p>Cabalists who become part of this cabal have great skill at inflicting pain and torture upon their enemies. At 1st level you gain the Accursed Eyes cabalist feat. When you inflict a condition with a value using a spell or feat with the curse or hex traits, you can spend a Focus Point to increase that condition&rsquo;s value by one (for example, if your evil eye would inflict frightened 1, it inflicts frightened 2 instead). You gain a focus pool containing 1 Focus Point.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: var(--p-space); max-width: min(90%,var(--max-width)); width: 520px; font-family: 'Roboto Condensed',var(--sans-serif);\"><strong>Unbound</strong></h3>\n<p>Some cabalists choose not to formally join a cabal, preferring to navigate their newfound powers on their own.
