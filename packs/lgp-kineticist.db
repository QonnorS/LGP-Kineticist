The connection with your elemental plane gives you near limitless magic, though not as potent as a wizard or druid&rsquo;s most powerful spells.</p>\n<h2>During Social Encounters...</h2>\n<p>Your power over the elements can be intimidating to those with more mundane skills. This can cause your foes to cower in fear, but often makes more tense negotiations even more volatile.</p>\n<h2>While Exploring...</h2>\n<p>You can use your extraordinary movement powers and unusual sensory abilities to go places and detect things you companions cannot. You&rsquo;re at your best when surrounded by your element.</p>\n<h2>In Downtime...</h2>\n<p>You might research and explore the nature of your element even more, seeking out places in the world that help you better understand your elemental connection and strengthen that bond. You may find a trade that ties in closely with your element, giving you an edge over your competition.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Wish to learn more about your associated elemental plane and explore the nature of your elemental nature.</li>\n<li>Have a personality that is in tune with your element, such as a fiery temper, an icy demeanor, an airy light heartedness, or rock solid stubbornness.</li>\n<li>Seek a hobby or profession to help define you over and above your elemental inclinations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Distrust or are envious of your ability to command the elements without training.</li>\n<li>Assume you are associated with an elemental lord or extra-planar power.</li>\n<li>See you as an embodiment of your associated element and nothing more, failing to see your true self.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Initial Proficiencies</h1>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics.

This determines your initial kinetic blast, the types of class feats you can take, and how your elemental defense improves as you level up.</p>\n<p><strong>Aether:</strong> You have a connection with the Ethereal Plane and gain telekinetic powers.<br /><strong>Air: </strong>You have a connection with the Plane of Air and gain power over wind.<br /><strong>Cold:</strong> You have a connection with the Plane of Water and gain power over ice and snow.<br /><strong>Earth:</strong> You have a connection with the Plane of Earth and gain power over dirt, stone, and metal.<br /><strong>Electricity:</strong> You have a connection with the Plane of Air and gain power over electricity.<br /><strong>Fire:</strong> You have a connection with the Plane of Fire and gain power over flame.<br /><strong>Water:</strong> You have a connection with the Plane of Water and gain power over water.</p>\n<h2><strong>Elemental Defense</strong></h2>\n<p>Starting at 1st level, you gain special defenses based on your Elemental Conduit. At 1st level, you gain an elemental defense power and increase to a single saving throw proficiency based on your Elemental Conduit. At 5th, 9th, 13th and 17th levels you gain an increase to your elemental defense power and either your armor or saving throw proficiencies.</p>\n<p>You gain one of the following based on your Elemental Conduit: <br /><strong>Aether:</strong> You instinctively manipulate strands of aether to move yourself out of harm&rsquo;s way. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.<br /><strong>Air:</strong> Your body flows like the currents of air. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.<br /><strong>Cold:</strong> Your body becomes as unyielding ice. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.<br /><strong>Earth:</strong> Your body is suffused with the resilience of stone. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.<br /><strong>Electric:</strong> Your body twitches and moves with the sudden flash of lightning. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.<br /><strong>Fire:</strong> Time around hot embers has honed your reflexes. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.<br /><strong>Water:</strong> Your experience with the relentlessness of water has fortified your body. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Legendary <strong>Kineticist Spellcasting</strong></h2>\n<p>Your Elemental Conduit provides you with direct access to primal energies. Though you don&rsquo;t gain traditional spellcasting abilities, you gain access to raw elemental power through a powerful cantrip called a kinetic blast. You can cast a kinetic blast using the Cast a Spell activity, which typically uses a somatic component.</p>\n<p>Your kinetic blasts require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your targets roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability score is Constitution, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Constitution modifier.</p>\n<p>You can alter your kinetic blast with special metamagic focus spells called infusions. They can increase the damage, area of effectiveness, or cause additional effects (see below) by expending Focus Points. However, you can Accept Burn (see below) in place of expending Focus Points to cast these special metamagic spells.</p>\n<p>Even though your tradition is primal, you are only considered to have a spell on your spell list if the spell has a trait that matches one of your Elemental Conduits. For example, a pyrokineticist with the fire Elemental Conduit has both fireball and flame strike on their spell list because both have the fire trait. If you have the Aether Elemental Conduit, spells with the Force trait are on your spell list, as are spells that involve telekinesis, at your GMs discretion.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>Your kinetic blast is a cantrip, which is a special type of spell that doesn&rsquo;t use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. For example, as a 1st-level legendary kineticist, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th level legendary kineticist, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells. You can choose to cast your cantrips at a lower level, if you wish.</p>\n<h2>Infusions</h2>\n<p>As a legendary kineticist, you can augment your kinetic blast through special metamagic focus spells called infusions. These infusions come in two different varieties: form infusions and substance infusions. A single kinetic blast can only be affected by one substance infusion and one form infusion.</p>\n<p>Form infusions usually change the way your attack manifests, or allow your attack to affect an entire area. As you increase in level, you&rsquo;ll automatically gain access to different universal form infusions.</p>\n<p>Substance infusions change what sorts of effects a kinetic blast has when it successfully affects a target; these generally allow your target to attempt a saving throw to reduce the effects.</p>\n<p>Infusions require spending a Focus Point. You gain 1 Focus Point the first time you learn a new infusion. Each time you gain an additional infusion, you gain an additional Focus Point up to a maximum of 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p>You must cast your infusion on the same turn as casting your kinetic blast cantrip. Certain infusions will only work with certain kinetic blasts, others work with all kinetic blasts. Read the description of the infusion to see which kinetic blasts it&rsquo;s compatible with If the infusion will lists one or more required Elemental Conduits, it is only compatible with blasts that have matching Elemental Conduit traits. Most form infusions work with any type of kinetic blast.</p>\n<h2>Burn</h2>\n<p>You gain the ability to sacrifice your own health by over-channeling elemental power through your body and producing powerful effects. This shocks your body, leaving you unable to act as you recover from the surge of sudden power. You gain the Accept Burn action.</p>\n<h2>Gather Power</h2>\n<p>You can take your time to siphon power from the elemental planes by Gathering Power. This allows you to safely channel powerful magic without using your own reserves and reduces the Focus Point cost of your next infusion.</p>\n<h2>Refocus</h2>\n<p>When you use the Refocus activity, you must spend 10 minutes interacting with one of your Elemental Conduits. Some examples are listed below:<br /><strong>Aether:</strong> Spent time arranging objects, dismantling or constructing and object, using the Medicine skill <br /><strong>Air:</strong> Dancing, singing, performing calisthenics, standing in a windy place, playing a wind instrument <br /><strong>Cold:</strong> Shoveling snow, sculpting ice, consuming a frozen food or beverage, building a snowman <br /><strong>Earth:</strong> Digging, stacking stones, sitting on the ground and meditating, climbing, carving rocks <br /><strong>Electricity:</strong> Standing in a lightning storm, working with metal, creating static electricity <br /><strong>Fire: </strong>Building a fire, staring into a fire, cooking <br /><strong>Water: </strong>Gathering water, bathing, laundering clothes, boiling or poaching food</p>\n<h2>Infusions</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, you learn a new infusion. These are special focus spells that modify the next kinetic blast you cast before the end of your turn. You can select any infusion you qualify for; many infusions require access to a specific Elemental Conduit and only work with blasts associated with that Elemental Conduit.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry and Background</h2>\n<p>In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background.</p>\n<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training.
